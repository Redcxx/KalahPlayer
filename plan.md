# AI & Games Plan

- Rules + heuristics, if has time, create a model

each seed 1 point, number of seeds: 7

### Rules & Heuristic

### Heuristic

- my store seed - other store seed

#### Rules

- If found a move that gives us > half of the stones, then take that move.
- If the number of seeds in a hole send us to the store, we can take that move
  - note search from right to left

- If we have empty hole that can fill and its opposite has stone, then do that move.

#### (?)

- If opponent can move to its store, try to prevent it (?)
- If opponent has empty hole (that opponent can fill).
  - Fill their hole.
  - Empty our opposite hole.

- Max(Tree search + heuristic)

#### Conditions

- Start
- We have empty holes
  - try to fill it
- Opponent chosen some hole. They have empty holes (chosen that hole or eaten by us)





- alpha pruning
- find some good heuristic (github & think & play)
- read & learn about RL
  - train a small model
  - google colab
